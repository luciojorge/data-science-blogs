            "never having been crossed by man.  It is just like a sharp sword,\n",
            "and therefore all the people call it `the sword-bridge'.  Now I\n",
            "have told you all the truth I know.\"  But they ask of her once\n",

            "crooked road, but the best and the most direct; and thus\n",
            "proceeding unguided, he brings him into an open plain.  In this\n",
            "plain there was a ford, on the other side of which a knight stood\n",
            "armed, who guarded it, and in his company there was a damsel who\n",

            "the other side cries out: \"Knight, I am guarding the ford, and\n",
            "forbid you to cross.\"  He neither gives him heed, nor hears his\n",
            "words, being still deep in thought.  In the meantime, his horse\n",
            "advanced rapidly toward the water.  The knight calls out to him\n",
            "that he will do wisely to keep at a distance from the ford, for\n",
            "there is no passage that way; and he swears by the heart within\n",

            "And the horse, quickly leaving the bank, leaps into the ford and\n",
            "greedily begins to drink.  And the knight says he shall pay for\n",
            "this, that his shield and the hauberk he wears upon his back\n",
            "shall afford him no protection.  First, he puts his horse at a\n",
            "gallop, and from a gallop he urges him to a run, and he strikes\n",
            "the knight so hard that he knocks him down flat in the ford which\n",
            "he had forbidden him to cross.  His lance flew from his hand and\n",
            "the shield from his neck.  When he feels the water, he shivers,\n",
            "and though stunned, he jumps to his feet, like one aroused from\n",
            "sleep, listening and looking about him with astonishment, to see\n",
            "who it can be who has struck him.  Then face to face with the\n",
            "other knight, he said: \"Vassal, tell me why you have struck me,\n",
            "when I was not aware of your presence, and when I had done you no\n",
            "harm.\"  \"Upon my word, you had wronged me,\" the other says: \"did\n",
            "you not treat me disdainfully when I forbade you three times to\n",
            "cross the ford, shouting at you as loudly as I could?  You surely\n",
            "heard me challenge you at least two or three times, and you\n",
            "entered in spite of me, though I told you I should strike you as\n",

            "\"Whoever heard you or saw you, let him be damned, so far as I am\n",

            "cross the ford.  But be assured that I would make you reset it,\n",
            "if I could just lay one of my hands on your bridle.\"  And the\n",

            "perfectly.  However the affair may turn out, I should like to lay\n",
            "my hands on you.\"  Then the other knight advances to the middle\n",
            "of the ford, where the other lays his left hand upon his bridle,\n",

            "Lancelot is so ashamed and mortified that he hates himself, for\n",
            "he knows full well that all have seen how, for some time past, he\n",

            "so manoeuvres as to force Meleagant into a position between him\n",
            "and the tower.  Meleagant makes every effort to regain his former\n",
            "position.  But Lancelot rushes upon him, and strikes him so\n",
            "violently upon his body and shield whenever he tries to get\n",
            "around him, that he compels him to whirl about two or three times\n",

            "partly because he has love's aid, and partly because he never\n",

            "mortal hate, so fierce that never before was such hate seen, make\n",
            "him so fiery and bold that Meleagant ceases to treat it as a jest\n",
            "and begins to stand in awe of him, for he had never met or known\n",
            "so doughty a knight, nor had any knight ever wounded or injured\n",
            "him as this one does.  He is glad to get away from him, and he\n",
            "winces and sidesteps, fearing his blows and avoiding them.  And\n",
            "Lancelot does not idly threaten him, but drives him rapidly\n",
            "toward the tower where the Queen was stationed on the watch.\n",
            "There upon the tower he did her the homage of his blows until he\n",
            "came so close that, if he advanced another step, he would lose\n",
            "sight of her.  Thus Lancelot drove him back and forth repeatedly\n",
            "in whatever direction he pleased, always stopping before the\n",
            "Queen, his lady, who had kindled the flame which compels him to\n",
            "fix his gaze upon her.  And this same flame so stirred him\n",
            "against Meleagant that he was enabled to lead and drive him\n",
            "wherever he pleased.  In spite of himself he drives him on like a\n",
            "blind man or a man with a wooden leg.  The king sees his son so\n",
            "hard pressed that he is sorry for him and he pities him, and he\n",
            "will not deny him aid and assistance if possible; but if he\n",
            "wishes to proceed courteously, he must first beg the Queen's\n",
            "permission.  So he began to say to her: \"Lady, since I have had\n",
            "you in my power, I have loved you and faithfully served and\n",

            "killed; not because he has not wronged both you and him, but\n",
            "because I make the request of you: so tell him, please, to stop\n",
            "beating him.  If you will, you can thus repay me for what I have\n",

            "Meleagant, beside himself with rage and shame when he hears that\n",
            "it has been necessary to intercede in his behalf, strikes him\n",
            "with all the strength he can muster.  And the king went down from\n",
            "the tower to upbraid his son, and entering the list he addressed\n",
            "him thus: \"How now?  Is this becoming, to strike him when he is\n",

            "prowess is now out of place!  For we all know beyond a doubt that\n",
            "he is thy superior.\"  Then Meleagant, choking with shame, says to\n",
            "the king: \"I think you must be blind!  I do not believe you see a\n",

            "replies, \"for all the people know whether thou speakest the truth\n",

            "azure blue?  That is Ignaures the well-beloved, a lover himself\n",
            "and jovial.  And he who bears the shield with the pheasants\n",
            "portrayed beak to beak is Coguillanz of Mautirec.  Do you see\n",
            "those two side by side, with their dappled steeds, and golden\n",
            "shields showing black lions?  One is named Semiramis, and the\n",

            "through which a stag appears to be passing out?  That is King\n",
            "Ider, in truth.\"  Thus they talk up in the stand.  \"That shield\n",
            "was made at Limoges, whence it was brought by Pilades, who is\n",
            "very ardent and keen to be always in the fight.  That shield,\n",
            "bridle, and breast-strap were made at Toulouse, and were brought\n",
            "here by Kay of Estraus.  The other came from Lyons on the Rhone,\n",
            "and there is no better under heaven; for his great merit it was\n",
            "presented to Taulas of the Desert, who bears it well and protects\n",
            "himself with it skilfully.  Yonder shield is of English\n",

            "which appear as if about to fly; yet they do not move, but\n",
            "receive many blows from the Poitevin lances of steel; he who has\n",
            "it is poor Thoas.\"  Thus they point out and describe the arms of\n",
            "those they know; but they see nothing of him whom they had held\n",
            "in such contempt, and, not remarking him in the fray, they\n",
            "suppose that he has slipped away.  When the Queen sees that he is\n",
            "not there, she feels inclined to send some one to search for him\n",
            "in the crowd until he be found.  She knows of no one better to\n",
            "send in search of him than she who yesterday performed her\n",
            "errand.  So, straightway calling her, she said to her: \"Damsel,\n",

            "not delay for any cause, and tell him again to do his `worst'.\n",
            "And when you have given him this message, mark well what reply he\n",
            "makes.\"  The damsel makes no delay, for she had carefully noticed\n",
            "the direction he took the night before, knowing well that she\n",
            "would be sent to him again.  She made her way through the ranks\n",

            "which she sends him.  And he makes answer: \"My thanks to her,\n",

            "command and prayer that he shall do his \"best \"; and she says she\n",

            "where her valet with the palfrey was awaiting her.  She mounted\n",
            "and rode until she found the knight, to whom she said at once:\n",

            "left, he allowed his shield and lance and trappings to fall where\n",

            "disappeared.  But he went straight back to the place whence he\n",
            "had come, to keep his oath.  When the tournament broke up, they\n",
            "all searched and asked for him, but without success, for he fled\n",
            "away, having no desire to be recognised.  The knights are\n",
